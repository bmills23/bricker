# About
Test1 is a **mildly annoying** script if $i is set to a large number.  This script will generate a large quantity of text files of up to a gigabyte **EACH**.  

Test2 is a **moderately dangerous** script that is a compounding version of test1.  If $i and $j are set to large numbers, the script will generate a large amount of batch files which will in turn generate large text files of up to a gigabyte in size.  It will bog down your CPU and fill your hard drive and will be impossible to stop without a hard reset.  The highest $i and $j can be is 100,000,000.  Therefore, theoretically speaking, if the computer can handle the concurrent processes and absurb file writing, this script has the potential to output 100,000 **EXABYTES** (100 trillion gigabytes) of useless textfile data.  Isn't that nuts?  Of course, it will never get that far most likely, but it's fun to think about.
